    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <P>Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking.
         Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser!
         The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!').
          For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store. 
        
    </P>
    
    <h3> Ingredient</h3>
   
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
        <li>Â½ cup barbeque sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Direction</h3>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
            Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </p>

        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.</p>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
            Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.
        </p>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>
            Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes.
            Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.

        </p>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>
            Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust; top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.

        </p>

        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>



    </ul>
